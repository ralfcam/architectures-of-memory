# Research Notes Template & Quality Bar

Applies to: `series/architectures-of-memory/book-*/research/notes/**/*.md`

Every note must include:

```markdown
# Research Note: Ch.NN — Short title
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Linear Issue:** ARC-NN
**Queries:** [numbered list]

## Findings
[Output with inline canonical DOIs/URLs, grouped by query]

## Verified Claims
- [ ] or [x] claim → source (BibTeX key in sources.bib + OKF card in evidence-cards/)

## Open Questions
- ...
```

- **No naked paraphrase** of a primary source without a short quoted excerpt or explicit pointer (DOI / URL / `sources.bib` key).
- **Never** paste raw `vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/` URLs.
