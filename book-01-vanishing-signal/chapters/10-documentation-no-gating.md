## The tragedy of the documentation commons

**Martin J. Eppler** and **Jeanne Mengis**, in an *Information Society* review that has become a standard reference, catalogue **causes of information overload** that cross disciplines—characteristics of the person, of the information itself, of tasks, of organizational process, and of **information technology** that *lower the cost of production* without a matching tax on *consumption*. The architectural point for institutions is (5): email, wikis, and intranets that make writing cheap can make *finding* *true* and *useful* **expensive**. Each author’s rational add becomes the commons’ irrational noise.[^eppler2004]

A firm’s **knowledge base** is not “failed” the day it launches. It is failed the day nobody has **permission to forget**—or to govern what stays *valid*. The contrast with the last chapter is instructive. A reorg is a *sudden* substrate **loss**; a runaway wiki is a *slow* dilution of *relevance*—a recurrent state in which *everything* the firm ever said remains in the **corpus** unless someone **removes** it, while nothing in the system *automatically* downweights the stale.

## Technical lens — A recurrent state without a forget gate

A plain recurrent network *without* a gating path keeps one hidden **trajectory** through time: old activations and new input add in fixed roles; stale **context** and current **signal** can fight in the same **vector**. The LSTM family, which *Book* *2* takes up as *engineering* (*The* *Forget* *Gate*), was built to **choose** what to carry and what to **discard** (forget gate, input gate) because unbounded **accumulation** in time is not *neutral* for learning—it is a **structural** hazard.[^bridge]

An “open” enterprise wiki that **treats** every new page as *equally* authoritative in retrieval is, in the analogy, a state in which the text base only *grows*; the reader is left to guess what still **matters**. The mechanism the LSTM line discovered—a **trainable** choice about *how* much of the past to attenuate in each **dimension**—is what a curation-poor **knowledge management** platform does **not** implement in software, governance, or roles.

Gating is not a decoration. It is how you **bound** a memory when **inflow** is unpriced.

## Organizational lens — Decay, vendor numbers, and the tax on experts

What reads as “helpful” on launch can rot on a faster clock than most governance cycles touch. A 2025 industry blog (Episteca) attributes dramatic figures to Readme- and Zoomin-sourced data—**API**-**class** technical documentation *materially* stale on the order of **tens of days**, and large fractions of enterprise technical content not updated for half-year or year scales. As of 2026 the **original** vendor **reports** for those exact numbers are not independently **archived** in **forms** this book can **verify** (see research/fact-checks/ch10-residual). Treat the Episteca figures as *vendor-routed* **order of magnitude**, not a peer-reviewed experiment. A **citable** independent result in the same **direction** is **Mimouni** *et al.* (2022) on **outdated** code-element references in popular GitHub **project** **documentation** (arXiv preprint).[^episteca2025][^mimouni2022]

**Lester J. Holtzblatt**, **Laurie E. Damianos**, and **Daniel Weiss** (MITRE) used **Contextual Inquiry** with 26 **participants** in an **extended** **abstract** at **CHI 2010** to map impediments to **internal** wiki use—a **qualitative** portrait of one large not-for-profit R&D **employer**, not a **statistical** law of all firms. The tension is as much **social** as **technical**: **reluctance** to **share** unfinished or **sensitive** work on open pages; **reliance** on familiar **non-wiki** channels—**governance** **deficits** (ownership, curation) more than a universal “people hate wikis” mood.[^holtzblatt2010]

Practitioner research in the DORA/Accelerate tradition—cited, in the Episteca-mediated chain this chapter uses for the documentation–onboarding link—gives a plausible **mechanism** for cost: if juniors cannot **trust** the **knowledge** **base**, they **revert** to **shadowing** seniors, **converting** expert time into **tour-guide** time and **bypassing** the transactive-memory routing **efficiency** Chapter 9 **described** (ask a sage **instead** of a search **box**).

## Philosophical lens — Communities of practice as *social* forget gates

The cure managers want to *buy* from a vendor may need to *grow* in **communities of practice (CoP)**. **Jean Lave** and **Etienne** **Wenger** (1991) are the **primary** source for the ethnographic **origin** of **situated** **learning** and “legitimate peripheral **participation**.” **E.** **Wenger**’s 1998 monograph is the primary for the *sociology-level* **framework** of communities of practice—mutual **engagement**, joint **enterprise**, shared **repertoire**; **E.** Wenger, **R.** **McDermott**, and **W.** **M.** **Snyder** (2002) is the primary for *cultivating* **communities** as an **organizational** **knowledge** **intervention**.[^lavewenger1991][^wenger1998][^wenger2002]

The three texts answer different questions; do not collapse them. A mature **CoP** **governs** its knowledge a little like a well-trained **forget** **gate**: people in daily **contact** with the **work** may **falsify** a **stale** page; **reputation** and **repeated** **use** supply **pressure** to **revise** or **remove**—a **selective** **editing** of the **corpus** that a read-only **repository** **cannot** do by metadata **alone**.

## The architectural gap to Book 2

What the **gated** RNN **family** did in **code** (*Book* *2*), vendors of “wiki as filing **cabinet**” **rarely** did in **product** **design** for **human** **curation** **incentives** and **roles**. A **knowledge** **base** is not a **theory** of **relevance**; an LSTM is a **theory** of **relevance** **under** a **loss** **function**. The **compliance** **extreme**—**“remember** **everything** in **the** **log**” without **assimilation**—waits in the **next** **chapter**: a **pathology** of a **different** **sign** than **vanishing** **gradients** **alone**.
